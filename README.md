# Jumia Products Data Analysis

This project is a Streamlit-based dashboard for analyzing Jumia products data. It encompasses data scraping, cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and interactive visualization. This is the capstone project for the Data Bootcamp at Lux Tech Academy.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Scraping**
2. **Data Cleaning**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Interactive Dashboard**

## 1. Data Scraping

The `JumiaScrapeSQLite3.ipynb` script scrapes product data from Jumia's website and stores it in a SQLite database. It uses Selenium for web scraping and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing.

## 2. Data Cleaning

The `JumiaEDA.ipynb` script processes the raw data from the SQLite database, preparing it for analysis by removing unnecessary symbols and handling missing values. The eda script generates descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data better.

## 4. Interactive Dashboard

The `dashboard.py`  script creates an interactive dashboard using Streamlit for visual exploration of the data.
